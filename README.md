# gg-calculator-app

This repository contains the code for the app built in the [gg tutorial](https://gg.thomasheyenbrock.vercel.app/docs/tutorial).

For each step in the tutorial there is a separate branch that shows the final code after completing the step. Each commit in the history exactly relates to one diff shown in the tutorial.
